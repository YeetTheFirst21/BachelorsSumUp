# Cyberphysical Systems [15.04-15.07/2024]
A course held by Prof.Amr Alanwar where students are required to create a harware+software project for Summer Semester 2024.

Me and my teammates have recreated the Prof. Amr Alanwar's research paper on reinforcement learning safety layer in a real life environment with limited hardware capabilities.

We have mapped a real life map to a virtual one and kept track of the movements done by a reinforcement algorithm and stopped possible safety hazards,"illegal moves", before they could happen.
