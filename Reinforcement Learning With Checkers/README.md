# Reinforcement Learning on Checkers [15.08-05.02/2024-2025]
A course held by Xie Jingui where students are required to create a reinforcement learning model capable of playing and beating other checker bots for Winter Semester 2024/2025.

Me and my friend, Roman Mishchuk have created multiple reinforcement learning models with multiple different algorithms and have compared their performances.

We have trained all of the models and have spent quite a marginal amount of time in order to make the GUI , thank you Roman for making us spend all that tinme :), user-friendly and also debug-friendly.
