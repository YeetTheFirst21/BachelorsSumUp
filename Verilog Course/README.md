# VHDL-Verilog Programming Course [27.04-25.09/2023]
A course held by Prof. Carsten Trinitis where students are meant to program an fpga devboard to function as a real riskV processor in Winter semester 2024/2025.

I have mostly worked on actually making the program work on Xilinx zynq p2 fpga board with AMD Vivado software and have learned quite a deal in IP creations.

Altough at the end we were unable to read and write to memory as we desired, we were able to emulate a riskV processor as we hoped.
