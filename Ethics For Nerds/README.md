# Ethics For Nerds [27.04-25.09/2023]
A course held by Prof. Carsten Trinitis and Prof. Michael Stich to allow students both from TUM Campus Heilbronn and TUM Garching to discuss regarding ethics in modern technology in Summer Semester 2023.

Me and Matej Svaral met together on the first meeting in April in Garching where my laptop was malfunctioning and talking about how mnuch that affected my day with him, we later on became a group for the seminar.

Then later on wrote the paper that can be found in this folder/directory and presented in Heilbronn regarding the general focus on Open Source Software under the name "Tragedy of the common goods with digital goods"

We pointed out the general benefits and negative impacts of open source software while also showcasing that we in the presentation itself was using open source software with an Orange Pi System on board to present.



Thank you Matej for the great time and discussions we had together!
